# Code repository for analyses conducted in Stange et al.

This code repository is associated with our manuscript entitled "Bayesian divergence-time estimation with genome-wide SNP data of sea catfishes (Ariidae) supports Miocene closure of the Panamanian Isthmus", which has been submitted for peer review. A preprint of the manuscript is available from bioRxiv ([https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/21/102129](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/21/102129)).

More information on the individual analyses can be found in the `README.md` files provided in subdirectories (e.g. `winston_reanalysis/README.md`).

Analyses were conducted in the following order:

1. `snapp_validation`
2. `betancur_reanalysis`
3. `species_tree_estimation`
4. `geography_reconstruction`
5. `winston_reanalysis`

Analyses conducted with the code in directory `one_on_x_prior_test` are complementary; these are not described in our manuscript. This directory also includes result files for a comparison of the performance of two alternative prior distributions for the Theta parameter.
