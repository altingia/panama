per-generation mutation rate per site = 0.000000001
per-generation mutation rate per SNP in dataset 1 = 0.000000001/0.036062 = 0.000000027730021

Theta 1 = 4 * 25000 * 0.000000027730021 = 0.0027730021
Theta 1 = 4 * 25000 * 0.00000003373933 = 0.003373933

estimated from dataset 1:
per-million-year mutation rate per SNP = 0.0063184
per-generation mutation rate per SNP = 0.0063184/(1000000/5) = 0.000000031592


true value used in simulation:
per-million-year mutation rate per alignment site = 0.0002
per-million-year mutation rate per SNP = 0.0002 / 0.036062 = 0.0002 * 200 / 7.2124 = 0.005546004104
